# Taufuscator

A simple utility to make running other people's mods in dev easier on Minecraft Forge. (Currently only works with 1.18.2-1.20.1).

## Usage

Download the latest version from https://nightly.link/TauMC/Taufuscator/workflows/build-snapshot/main/Taufuscator.zip,
extract the zip, and place the included JAR in the `mods` folder of your development workspace (usually `run/mods`).

You can now place obfuscated mod JAR files in the mods folder as usual, and they will be remapped at launch time.
