# Taufuscator

A simple utility to make running other people's mods in dev easier on Minecraft Forge. (Currently only works with 1.18.2-1.20.1).

## Usage

Download the latest JAR from https://maven.taumc.org/#/releases/org/taumc/taufuscator/1.0-SNAPSHOT
and place it in the `mods` folder of your development workspace (usually `run/mods`).

You can now place obfuscated mod JAR files in the mods folder as usual, and they will be remapped at launch time.
